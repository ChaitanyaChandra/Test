Semi-supervised Learning
A hybrid form of unsupervised and supervised learning is also available in the
form of semi-supervised learning, which is used for datasets that contain a mix
of labeled and unlabeled cases. With the “more data the better” as a core
motivator, the goal of semi- supervised learning is to leverage unlabeled cases to
improve the reliability of the prediction model. One technique is to build the
initial model using the labeled cases (supervised learning) and then use the same
model to label the remaining cases (that are unlabeled) in the dataset. The model
can then be retrained using a larger dataset (with less or no unlabeled cases).
Alternatively, the model could be iteratively re-trained using newly labeled cases
that meet a set threshold of confidence and adding the new cases to the training
data after they meet the set threshold. There is, however, no guarantee that a
semi-supervised model will outperform a model trained with less data (based
exclusively on the original labeled cases).
